## Notes:
PROVIDE RELEVANT OR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HERE. Below are formatting options to add emphasis in text
<ul>
  <li>Unique User: Slow reader (1 second per word). Affinity towards keywords, links, and images.</li>
  <li>When testing for links, I had to specifically make the links in my react app open in a blank window for it to keep my script running. While this works for my website, there is probably a better more universal option to account for other websites.</li>
  <li>I used this <a href="https://murphy.academic.csusb.edu/cse4310/">website</a> to test Unique user w/o preference. It only contains links and listed items. Had to disable links on the script for the above reason.</li>
</ul>
